I'm an final year student and a Software developer intern at Accubits focusing on Front-end development and blockchain.


## My Projects ‚ù§Ô∏è

- [<b>eversky - NFT Marketplace </b>](https://eversky.vercel.app/) : A blockchain-based web application that allows users to list, buy and resell NFTs. I implemented the user interface of the application using Next JS and Tailwindcss and built custom smart contract for the NFT marketplace.


- [<b>CovTrack19 </b>](https://github.com/kevinjacob2001/CovTrack) : It's an end-to-end and easily accessible platform that can provide all kinds of data including live vaccination count details and available beds count at COVID-19 hospitals across India and much more. I was responsible for developing the front-end as well as integrating APIs.

- [<b>Token Makes</b>](https://token-makes.vercel.app/) : A NFT Marketplace's landing page UI in NextJS based on inspirations from Dribble! 

- [<b>Discord clone</b>](https://discord-kevinjacob.web.app/) : Discord clone developed using React, Redux, Firestore, and integrated with Firebase authentication.

- [<b>Chat application</b>](https://chatapp-kevinjacob2001.vercel.app) : A WhatsApp-inspired chat application that allows users to send messages. Developed the front-end using NextJS, and integrated authentication using Firebase. Firestore is used the database so as to assure high uptime.
